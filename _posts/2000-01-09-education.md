#### Educational background

I studied in Bauman Moscow State Technical University and have got bachelor's degree in Computer Systems and Networks in 2015.

I took following courses among others during sudy:

* Higher mathematics courses such as Discrete mathematics, Automata theory, Linear algebra, Mathematical logic and so on.
* Programming basics (Pascal).
* Object-oriented programming (C++).
* Web programming (Ruby + RoR, CSS, JavaScript).
* Algorithms and data structures ([Standford course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) on Coursera).

I also used Ruby and C++ in several non-study project during this time:

* Plagiarism detection tool consisting of [SOAP service](https://github.com/dilcom/SOAP_PlagiarismChecker) written on C++ and frontend (modified [Moodle crot plugin](https://github.com/dilcom/moodle-plagiarism_crot) and standalone [Rails app](https://github.com/dilcom/DeplagiarismFrontendSmallApp)).
* Participating in development of [Sikulix gem](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-2014/tree/master/JRubyGem/lib) for Ruby and some research in using it together with RSpec and Cucumber in order to test UI of desktop applications. [This article](http://www.jmest.org/wp-content/uploads/JMESTN42350420.pdf) is based on that research.
* [Graduation project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ykjpgbhqfsmy) that related to building Continuous Deployment system based on Open Source products.
